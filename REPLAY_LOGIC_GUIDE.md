## üéØ **CRITICAL UNDERSTANDING**: The Two-Phase Pattern

### Phase 1: Replay from Sequence
1. **Read** entire `gameEnv.playSequence.plays` array
2. **Replay** every action in chronological order (sequenceId)
3. **Rebuild** all effects from scratch (zone restrictions, power boosts, etc.)
4. **Result**: Clean, consistent state based purely on action sequence

### Phase 2: Apply New Effects
1. **Add** new effects AFTER replay simulation
2. **Record** new actions in play sequence for future replays
3. **Update** immediate values (playerPoint, valueOnField)
4. **Result**: New effects persisted and ready for next replay

## üîÑ Card Selection Integration (h-2 Example)

### Traditional Flow (Before Selection Enhancement):
```
Player plays h-2 ‚Üí Effect triggers ‚Üí Player selects c-1 ‚Üí Power changes ‚Üí Done
```

### Enhanced Flow (With Replay Integration):
```
Player plays h-2 ‚Üí PLAY_CARD recorded ‚Üí Effect triggers ‚Üí 
Player selects c-1 ‚Üí Run full replay simulation ‚Üí Apply setPower effects ‚Üí 
Record APPLY_SET_POWER action ‚Üí Update playerPoint ‚Üí Done
```

### Key Difference:
The enhanced flow **preserves card selection information** in the play sequence, enabling:
- ‚úÖ Complete replay consistency  
- ‚úÖ Debug tracing of selections
- ‚úÖ Cross-player effect tracking
- ‚úÖ Future state reconstruction

## üìã Action Types Reference

### PLAY_LEADER
```javascript
{
  sequenceId: 1,
  playerId: "playerId_1", 
  cardId: "s-1",
  action: "PLAY_LEADER",
  zone: "leader",
  data: { isInjectedState: true }
}
```

### PLAY_CARD  
```javascript
{
  sequenceId: 4,
  playerId: "playerId_2",
  cardId: "h-2",
  action: "PLAY_CARD", 
  zone: "help",
  data: { isFaceDown: false, cardIndex: 0, fieldIndex: 3 }
}
```

### APPLY_SET_POWER (NEW - January 2025)
```javascript
{
  sequenceId: 5,
  playerId: "playerId_2",
  cardId: "h-2",
  action: "APPLY_SET_POWER",
  zone: "effect",
  data: {
    selectionId: "playerId_2_setPower_123",
    selectedCardIds: ["c-1"],
    targetPlayerId: "playerId_1", 
    effectType: "setPower",
    powerValue: 0,
    sourceCard: "h-2"
  }
}
```

## üîç Debugging the Replay System

### 1. Check Play Sequence
```javascript
// In browser console or Node.js debug:
console.log(gameEnv.playSequence.plays);
```
Look for:
- ‚úÖ Correct sequenceId order (1, 2, 3, 4, 5...)
- ‚úÖ All actions present (leaders, cards, effects)
- ‚úÖ APPLY_SET_POWER entries for card selections

### 2. Verify Field Effects
```javascript
console.log(gameEnv.players.playerId_1.fieldEffects);
```
Look for:
- ‚úÖ `calculatedPowers` with correct values
- ‚úÖ `zoneRestrictions` from leaders
- ‚úÖ `activeEffects` with power modifications

### 3. Test Replay Consistency
```javascript
// Save current state
const beforeReplay = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(gameEnv.players));

// Run replay simulation
await effectSimulator.simulateCardPlaySequence(gameEnv);

// Compare results - should be identical
const afterReplay = gameEnv.players;
```

## üö® Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue: Effects get cleared after card plays
**Cause**: Effects applied BEFORE simulation instead of AFTER
**Solution**: Always call `simulateCardPlaySequence()` FIRST, then add new effects

### Issue: Card selection not preserved in replay
**Cause**: Missing `APPLY_SET_POWER` entry in play sequence  
**Solution**: Ensure `applySetPowerSelection()` adds selection action to sequence

### Issue: playerPoint not updated after setPower
**Cause**: `calculatePlayerPoint()` not called after effect application
**Solution**: Always recalculate playerPoint after modifying card powers

### Issue: Zone restrictions not applied
**Cause**: Leader play sequence missing or not replayed
**Solution**: Ensure leaders recorded as `PLAY_LEADER` actions in sequence

## üîß Development Tips

### Adding New Effect Types
1. **Record** the effect in play sequence with appropriate action type
2. **Handle** the action type in `EffectSimulator.executePlayUnified()`
3. **Apply** effects in correct order (simulation first, then new effects)
4. **Test** replay consistency with your new effect type

### Extending Card Selection System
1. **Follow** the `APPLY_SET_POWER` pattern in `applySetPowerSelection()`
2. **Create** new action type (e.g., `APPLY_CARD_DRAW`)
3. **Record** selection details in `data` field
4. **Ensure** replay simulation can process the new action type

### Performance Considerations
- Replay simulation runs on every effect trigger
- Keep action sequences reasonable length (<100 actions)
- Consider checkpointing for very long games
- Use efficient data structures in field effects
