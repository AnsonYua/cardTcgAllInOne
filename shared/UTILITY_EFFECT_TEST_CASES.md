# Utility Effect Test Cases - Complete Documentation

## Overview

This document provides comprehensive documentation for all utility card effect test scenarios in the "Revolution and Rebellion" card game. All test cases use the **dynamic format** with action-based testing to validate utility card effects through actual gameplay simulation.

**Test Location**: `shared/testScenarios/gameStates/UtilityEffects/`  
**Test Format**: All tests use `*_dynamic.json` format for consistent, reliable validation  
**Created**: July 18, 2025 - Complete utility effect testing suite with all 8 missing effect types implemented

## Dynamic Test Cases

### 1. Comprehensive Integration Test

#### `utility_comprehensive_test.json`
- **Test Type**: Dynamic (action-based)
- **Description**: Tests multiple utility effects including neutralization, zone freedom, combo disruption, and power modifications
- **Setup**:
  - **Player 1**: Trump (s-1) - 愛國者 leader with zone restrictions
  - **Player 2**: Musk (s-6) - 經濟 leader
- **Actions Tested**:
  1. **Step 1**: Player 1 attempts to place c-1 (愛國者) in TOP zone - should fail due to zone restriction
  2. **Step 2**: Player 1 places h-5 (失智老人) - grants zone freedom + power boost
  3. **Step 3**: Player 1 places c-1 in TOP zone - should succeed due to zone freedom
  4. **Step 4**: Player 2 places h-1 (Deep State) - neutralizes opponent effects
  5. **Step 5**: Player 2 places c-21 (奧巴馬) - provides single target boost
  6. **Step 6**: Player 1 places sp-1 (天選之人) face-down - conditional neutralization
  7. **Step 7**: Player 2 places sp-8 (反特斯拉示威) face-down - combo disruption
- **Power Validation**:
  - `c-1` final power: **155** (100 base + 45 Trump boost + 10 self-boost + 0 h-5 neutralized)
  - `c-21` final power: **165** (80 base + 35 Musk boost + 50 self-boost)
- **Effect Interactions**:
  - Zone freedom overrides leader restrictions
  - Neutralization disables power boosts but not immunity
  - Combo disruption affects Musk leader specifically
- **Test Status**: ✅ **READY**

### 2. Neutralization and Immunity Test

#### `utility_neutralization_immunity_test.json`
- **Test Type**: Dynamic (action-based)
- **Description**: Tests h-5 immunity to neutralization effects - zone freedom should remain active despite h-1 neutralization
- **Setup**:
  - **Player 1**: Trump (s-1) - 愛國者 leader with zone restrictions
  - **Player 2**: Biden (s-2) - 左翼 leader (allows all types)
- **Actions Tested**:
  1. **Step 1**: Player 1 places h-5 (失智老人) - grants zone freedom + immunity
  2. **Step 2**: Player 1 attempts c-1 in TOP zone - should fail (zone freedom not yet applied)
  3. **Step 3**: Player 2 places h-1 (Deep State) - attempts neutralization
  4. **Step 4**: Player 1 places c-1 in TOP zone - should succeed (immune zone freedom)
  5. **Step 5**: Player 2 places c-21 (奧巴馬) - provides single target boost
- **Power Validation**:
  - `c-1` final power: **205** (100 base + 45 Trump boost + 10 self-boost + 50 Obama boost + 0 h-5 neutralized)
  - `c-21` final power: **120** (80 base + 40 Biden boost, Obama doesn't boost self)
- **Immunity Validation**:
  - Zone freedom remains active despite neutralization
  - Power boost from h-5 is neutralized (not immune)
  - Placement restrictions bypassed due to immune zone freedom
- **Test Status**: ✅ **READY**

### 3. Final Calculation Effects Test

#### `utility_final_calculation_test.json`
- **Test Type**: Dynamic (action-based)
- **Description**: Tests sp-6 (DeepSeek風暴) totalPowerNerf effect applied after combo calculation
- **Setup**:
  - **Player 1**: Trump (s-1) - 愛國者 leader
  - **Player 2**: Biden (s-2) - 左翼 leader
- **Actions Tested**:
  1. **Steps 1-6**: Fill all character zones with cards for combo calculation
  2. **Step 7**: Player 1 places h-1 (Deep State) - neutralizes opponent effects
  3. **Step 8**: Player 2 places h-5 (失智老人) - power boost neutralized, zone freedom immune
  4. **Step 9**: Player 1 places sp-6 (DeepSeek風暴) face-down - final calculation nerf
  5. **Step 10**: Player 2 places sp-1 (天選之人) face-down - triggers battle
- **Power Calculation**:
  - **Player 1**: 525 base + 150 combo = **675** (no nerf)
  - **Player 2**: 265 base + 0 combo - 80 nerf = **185** (after totalPowerNerf)
- **Effect Timing**:
  - Combo calculation happens first: Player 1 gets 右翼+愛國者 combo bonus
  - Final calculation effects apply after: sp-6 reduces Player 2's total by 80
  - Winner: Player 1 (675 > 185)
- **Test Status**: ✅ **READY**
