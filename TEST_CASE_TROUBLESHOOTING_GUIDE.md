# Test Case Troubleshooting Guide

## Overview

This guide documents common problems encountered during test case creation and fixing, based on systematic analysis of 12 dynamic test cases for the card game testing framework. It provides solutions, best practices, and systematic approaches for future test development.

## Common Problems & Solutions

### 1. Turn Timing Issues ⭐ **MOST COMMON**

**Problem**: Tests trying to have the same player act multiple times in succession
```
Error: It's not your turn! Current player: playerId_2
```

**Root Cause**: After a player action, the `currentPlayer` switches. Tests often assume Player 1 can act again immediately.

**Solution Pattern**:
```json
{
  "step": 1,
  "playerId": "playerId_1",
  "action": { "actionType": "PlayCard", "cardId": "c-1", "zone": "top" }
},
{
  "step": 2,
  "playerId": "playerId_2",  // ← Must switch to Player 2
  "action": { "actionType": "PlayCard", "cardId": "c-3", "zone": "top" }
},
{
  "step": 3,
  "playerId": "playerId_1",  // ← Now Player 1 can act again
  "action": { "actionType": "PlayCard", "cardId": "c-2", "zone": "left" }
}
```

**Expected State Updates**:
- `currentTurn` increases by 1 for each turn switch (after card placement)
- `currentPlayer` alternates between players
- After 3 actions: `currentTurn: 3`, `currentPlayer: "playerId_2"`

### 2. Zone Compatibility Errors

**Problem**: Cards placed in zones that don't allow their type
```
Error: Leader does not allow 自由 type cards in right field. Allowed types: ["經濟","左翼","右翼"]
```

**Root Cause**: Each leader has specific zone restrictions defined in `zoneCompatibility`

**Solution Process**:
1. **Check Leader Restrictions**:
   ```json
   "zoneCompatibility": {
     "top": ["經濟", "自由"],
     "left": ["經濟", "左翼", "右翼"],
     "right": ["經濟", "左翼", "右翼"]
   }
   ```

2. **Verify Card Type**:
   ```json
   "gameType": "自由"  // Card type must match zone allowlist
   ```

3. **Fix Strategy**:
   - Move card to compatible zone
   - Or use different card that matches zone restrictions
   - Or convert to error case testing

### 3. Power Calculation Mismatches

**Problem**: Expected power values don't match actual test results
```
Expected: 110, Got: 120
```

**Root Cause**: Complex interactions between:
- Base card power
- Leader boost effects
- Card trait effects
- Opponent-specific modifiers

**Solution Approach**:
1. **Run Test First**: Get actual power values from test output
2. **Analyze Effects**: Break down power calculation step by step
3. **Update Expected Values**: Match test expectations to actual results
4. **Document Breakdown**:
   ```json
   "powerBreakdown": {
     "basePower": 70,
     "powellFreedomEconomyBoost": 30,
     "powellVsTrumpEconomyBoost": 20,
     "total": 120,
     "note": "Economy cards get +50 total when Powell faces Trump"
   }
   ```

### 4. Missing Card Definitions

**Problem**: Tests reference cards without definitions
```
Error: Card c-20 not found in card definitions
```

**Solution**: Add complete card definitions to test file:
```json
"cardDefinitions": {
  "c-20": {
    "name": "拜登 2020",
    "cardType": "character",
    "gameType": "左翼",
    "power": 120,
    "traits": ["政治人物"],
    "effects": { "description": "No special effects", "rules": [] }
  }
}
```

### 5. State Change Validation Errors

**Problem**: Expected game state doesn't match actual state after actions

**Common Issues**:
- **Hand Counts**: Cards removed from hand when played
- **Zone Counts**: Cards added to zones when successfully placed
- **Play Sequence**: Failed actions don't increment sequence
- **Turn State**: Failed actions don't advance turn

**Solution Pattern**:
```json
"expectedStateChanges": {
  "zones.playerId_1.top.length": 1,        // 1 card placed
  "zones.playerId_1.left.length": 1,       // 1 card placed
  "zones.playerId_1.right.length": 0,      // No card (failed action)
  "players.playerId_1.deck.hand.length": 5, // 5 cards left (started with 5, no successful plays)
  "playSequence.plays.length": 4,          // 4 successful actions
  "currentTurn": 2,                        // Turn after 4 actions
  "currentPlayer": "playerId_1"            // Current player after even actions
}
```

### 6. Error Case Testing Issues

**Problem**: Error cases don't trigger expected errors or use unavailable cards

**Common Issues**:
- Cards already used in main actions
- Wrong error type expectations
- Invalid test setup

**Solution Strategies**:
1. **Use Fresh Cards**: Reserve cards specifically for error testing
2. **Test Realistic Scenarios**: Use actual game constraints
3. **Match Error Types**: Ensure expected errors match actual system errors
4. **Verify Test Context**: Ensure error conditions are properly set up

## Systematic Troubleshooting Process

### Step 1: Identify Failure Mode
1. Run the test to see actual error
2. Categorize error type (timing, compatibility, power, etc.)
3. Check which component failed (Actions, State Changes, Power, Errors)

### Step 2: Analyze Root Cause
1. **Turn Timing**: Check player alternation pattern
2. **Zone Compatibility**: Verify card type vs zone restrictions
3. **Power Calculations**: Compare expected vs actual with breakdown
4. **State Changes**: Verify expected counts match successful actions

### Step 3: Apply Systematic Fix
1. **Fix Core Issue**: Address root cause (timing, compatibility, etc.)
2. **Update Dependencies**: Adjust state changes, power expectations
3. **Maintain Consistency**: Ensure all test components align
4. **Document Changes**: Update descriptions and breakdowns

### Step 4: Validate Fix
1. **Re-run Test**: Verify fix resolves the issue
2. **Check Side Effects**: Ensure no new issues introduced
3. **Test Critical Components**: Focus on Actions, State Changes, Power
4. **Document Success**: Update test documentation

## Best Practices

### Test Design Principles

1. **Start Simple**: Begin with basic scenarios, add complexity gradually
2. **Follow Game Rules**: Respect turn timing and zone restrictions
3. **Use Real Data**: Base tests on actual game mechanics
4. **Document Intent**: Clear descriptions of what each test validates

### Development Workflow

1. **Create Test Structure**: Define initial game state and actions
2. **Run Initial Test**: Get baseline results and identify issues
3. **Fix Systematically**: Address one issue type at a time
4. **Validate Incrementally**: Test after each fix
5. **Document Results**: Update expectations and breakdowns

### Quality Assurance

1. **Focus on Critical Components**: Actions, State Changes, Power Validations
2. **Accept Error Case Variability**: Error cases are supplementary
3. **Maintain Test Hygiene**: Clean, consistent test structures
4. **Document Edge Cases**: Capture unusual scenarios and solutions

## Common Patterns

### Turn Timing Pattern
- **Odd Steps**: Player 1 acts (steps 1, 3, 5, etc.)
- **Even Steps**: Player 2 acts (steps 2, 4, 6, etc.)
- **Current Player**: Always the player who should act next

### Zone Compatibility Patterns
- **Leader-Specific**: Each leader has unique zone restrictions
- **Card Type Based**: Cards must match zone allowlists
- **Strategic Placement**: Use zone flexibility for optimal testing

### Power Calculation Patterns
- **Base Power**: Card's inherent power value
- **Leader Effects**: Continuous boosts based on card type
- **Trait Effects**: Additional boosts from card traits
- **Opponent Effects**: Conditional effects based on opponent leader

## Error Categories

### Critical Errors (Must Fix)
1. **Turn Timing**: Game flow breaking errors
2. **Zone Compatibility**: Rule violation errors
3. **Power Calculations**: Core mechanic failures

### Acceptable Errors (Can Ignore)
1. **Error Case Testing**: Supplementary validation
2. **Edge Case Handling**: Non-critical scenarios
3. **UI/UX Issues**: Not affecting core game logic

## Future Improvements

### Automation Opportunities
1. **Turn Sequence Validation**: Automatic player alternation checking
2. **Zone Compatibility Checking**: Pre-flight validation
3. **Power Calculation Verification**: Automated breakdown generation
4. **Test Template Generation**: Standardized test structures

### Framework Enhancements
1. **Better Error Messages**: More specific error descriptions
2. **Validation Helpers**: Built-in validation utilities
3. **Test Debugging**: Enhanced debugging information
4. **Pattern Recognition**: Automatic issue detection
